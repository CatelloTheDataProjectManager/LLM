Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing my skills and projects in Large Language Models (LLM) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Amazon SageMaker. This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate various techniques and applications in the field of NLP and LLM.

## About Me

I have experience working with Amazon SageMaker to build, train, and deploy machine learning models. My goal is to leverage these technologies to solve real-world problems and drive innovation.
