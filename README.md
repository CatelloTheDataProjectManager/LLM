Welcome to my GitHub repository, presenting my skills and projects on Large Language Models (LLM) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Amazon SageMaker. This repository is the result of an **AWS certification** and includes Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate various techniques and applications in these fascinating fields.
